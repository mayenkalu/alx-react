# React Redux Connectors and Providers

**Redux Connectors:**

Redux connectors are functions that allow React components to interact with the Redux store. They connect the component to the Redux store's state and actions, enabling components to access and update the global state.

**Using Connectors:**

Connectors are used by wrapping a component using the `connect()` function provided by React Redux. This function returns a higher-order component that provides the component with the necessary data and functions from the Redux store.

**Functions Passed to a Connector:**

- `mapStateToProps`: Maps parts of the Redux state to the component's props.
- `mapDispatchToProps`: Maps action creators to the component's props, allowing the component to dispatch actions.

**Mapping Action Creators:**

You can map an action creator to a component by passing it as an object to the `mapDispatchToProps` function in the `connect()` call. This makes the action creator available as a prop in the connected component.

**Mapping Async Action Creators with Redux Thunk:**

To map an async action creator that uses Redux Thunk, you dispatch the async action creator function returned by Thunk within your component. The async action creator can make API calls or perform other asynchronous operations.

**Redux Providers:**

Redux Providers are components provided by React Redux that wrap your application, making the Redux store accessible to all components within the app. The `Provider` component is placed at the root level of your component tree.

**Improving Connector Performance with Reselect:**

Reselect is a library that helps improve the performance of Redux selectors. It memoizes selector functions, avoiding unnecessary recalculations when the state doesn't change. This is especially useful when using complex selectors.

**Using Redux Dev Tools for Debugging:**

Redux DevTools is a browser extension that aids in debugging Redux applications. It provides a visual representation of the application's state over time, allowing you to inspect actions and state changes as they occur. This helps in identifying issues and understanding how the state evolves.
