# React Redux action creator+normalizr

**Normalizr's purpose and how to use it:**

- *Purpose*: Normalizr is a JavaScript library that helps with normalizing nested JSON data. It is commonly used in frontend applications to organize and manage data from APIs or databases.
- *How to use*: To use Normalizr, you define schemas that describe how your data is structured and how entities are related. You then pass your JSON data through these schemas using the `normalize()` function, which transforms the data into a normalized format. This normalized structure is easier to manage and update, especially when dealing with complex data with nested relationships.

**Schemas and normalization of nested JSON:**

- *Schemas*: Schemas in Normalizr define the shape of your data and its relationships. You define schema objects for different data types (entities) and specify how they are related to each other using schema keys.
- *Normalization*: Normalization is the process of transforming nested JSON data into a flat, normalized structure. This involves breaking down complex nested data into separate entities and using unique identifiers to represent relationships between them. This normalized structure is more efficient for updating, querying, and managing data.

**Core concepts of Redux:**

- *Store*: A centralized state container that holds the entire application's state.
- *Actions*: Plain JavaScript objects that represent events or intentions in the application.
- *Reducers*: Pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions. They take the previous state and an action as arguments and return a new state.
- *Dispatch*: A method used to send actions to the store, triggering the state change.

**Redux actions:**

- Actions are objects that describe events or changes in the application.
- They have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.
- They can carry additional data (payload) required for the action.

**Redux action creators:**

- Action creators are functions that create and return action objects.
- They help in centralizing the process of creating actions.
- They encapsulate the logic and payload creation related to an action.

**Async actions in Redux:**

- Async actions are used to handle asynchronous operations, such as API calls, in Redux.
- Libraries like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga are commonly used to manage async actions.
- An async action involves dispatching multiple actions in a sequence, typically `REQUEST`, `SUCCESS`, and `FAILURE` actions.

**How to write tests for Redux:**

*Reducers*: Write tests to ensure that reducers correctly handle actions and produce the expected state changes.
Action Creators: Test that action creators return the expected actions.
*Async Actions*: For async actions, test the different states of the asynchronous flow, such as pending, success, and failure.
Store Integration: Test how actions and reducers interact with the Redux store as a whole.
*Middleware*: If using middleware, test that it behaves as expected when dispatching actions.
*Selectors*: If you use selectors to derive data from the state, write tests to ensure their correctness.
Testing libraries like Jest and tools like Redux's official testing utilities (`@reduxjs/toolkit`'s `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`) can assist in writing comprehensive tests for Redux.
